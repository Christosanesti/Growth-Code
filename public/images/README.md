## Team Photos

Place team member photos in the `team/` subdirectory with the following naming convention:

- `michael-rodriguez.jpg` - Head of Marketing
- `emily-watson.jpg` - Creative Director
- `david-kim.jpg` - Senior Developer
- `lisa-anderson.jpg` - Marketing Strategist

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended 400x400px minimum for team photos (square aspect ratio)
- **File Size**: Optimize images to keep file sizes reasonable (< 200KB recommended)
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `team-member-name.jpg`)

## Adding Your Own Photos

1. Add team member photos to `public/images/team/`
2. Ensure filenames match the image paths in `app/page.tsx`
3. For best results, use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
4. Consider using Next.js Image Optimization by importing images properly
