# Images Directory

This directory contains all images used in the GrowthCode website.

## Team Photos

Place team member photos in the `team/` subdirectory with the following naming convention:
- `michelle-rodriguez.jpg` - Marketing Specialist
- `nawid.jpg` - Software Engineer

**Note:** Placeholder photos have been downloaded from Unsplash. Replace these with your actual team photos when ready.

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended 400x400px minimum for team photos (square aspect ratio)
- **File Size**: Optimize images to keep file sizes reasonable (< 200KB recommended)
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `team-member-name.jpg`)

## Adding Your Own Photos

1. Add team member photos to `public/images/team/`
2. Ensure filenames match the image paths in `app/page.tsx`
3. For best results, use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
4. Consider using Next.js Image Optimization by importing images properly

## Placeholder Images

If you don't have photos yet, the site will display initials in colored circles as fallbacks. You can also use placeholder services like:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
- Placeholder.com
- UI Avatars (https://ui-avatars.com)
